-Detective, if you forgive me, I don't want to tell you how to do your job but the man next to John was my teacher back in the day. He was caught in some devius things, true blasphemyâ€”demonic
worship, a guy like that is capable of anything. I bet if we send him to the hospital, we'll find pieces of Mrs. Gloria in his stomach. Of course it's your call but keep that in mind

-Hey remember that guy besides john?
-No, what about him?
-Haven't we gone to his birthday party earlier this year or something?

-Watch out for that manager next to Robert, heard rumor of him eating rats in the toilets before, creepy guy, I would lock him even if he's not the monster

-Mister Detective, this has nothing to do with the monster but hear me out: kill Ash, the younger one, if he's the abomination everything's fine, if not I can make his corpse look exactly like Gloria's,
we just have to tell that the thing freaked out when discovered.
