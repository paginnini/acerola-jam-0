Daily God's Town

new monster attack
yesterday gloria smith, 35, born and raised at God's Town, became the new victim of the abomination that curses this city in recent times.
She was found at home by her husband, James, already dead and eaten, made in piecesâ€”truly an horror. The police were called and when questioned about the
culprit by our reporters, told that this time they are certain that justice will be made, a detective came from outside and has five suspects under arrest.
Who exactly was kept secret, so our team went on a little investigation and found out one of the supposed aberration of the night: River Howard! river howard
from Downtown, there was always gossip about this guy, but I dont know, being weird is not a crime yet, you tell me, we haven't the identity of the other four so
maybe he's the most normal there. Anyway, send a letter with your guesses and tomorrow the person that get's it right will win free juice for a month at
the Sunday Siner.
