Daily God's Town

new monster attack
yesterday gloria smith, 35, born and raised at God's Town, became the new victim of the abomination cursing this city in recent times.
She was found at home by her husband, James, already dead and eaten, made into pieces—truly an horror. The police were called and when questioned about the
culprit by our reporters, told that this time they are certain that justice will be made, a detective came from outside and has five suspects under arrest.
Were exactly was kept in secrecy, so our team went on a little investigation and found out one as the supposed Aberration Of tThe Night: River Howard! River Howard
from Downtown, there was always some gossip going around about this guy, but I dont know, being weird is not a +crime yet, you tell me, we haven't identified the other four so
maybe he's the most normal one there. Anyway, send a letter with your guesses and tomorrow the person that get's it right will win free juice for a month at
the Sunday Diner.


God's Town anniversary
this past Wednesday was the 61º anniversary of this community's beloved town, and by coincidence also the 61º birthday of the new eldest member of the Smith family. thanks to the death of Jones Smith,
84, by the hands of the aberration of the night in january, we're now able to experience this magic event can happen and hopefully will continue to in the next years, we should all cherish this moment of an unusual
twinship, best regards and happy birthday, Mr. smith!
